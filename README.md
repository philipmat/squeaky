*squeaky* is a simple web proxy based on [A2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/a2freedom/) which in turn is 
based on the apparently defunct [PHProxy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phproxy/).

For a more popular, but not open source, proxy see [glype](http://www.glype.com).



## License
A2 is release under GPL, so *squeaky* follows. However, as A2 does not mention a specific GPL version, 
per paragraph 9, I choose to release *squeaky* under GPL v2.
